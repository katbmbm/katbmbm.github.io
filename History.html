				<p class="text-history-left"> The current brolo*, as well as the entirety of Galzignano, sits upon fertile volcanic soil. This is because of the geological nature of the surrounding hills, which were formed approximately 42 million years ago by volcanic eruptions, forming both the hills themselves and extensive underground reserves of hot water, that have not only allowed the development of plentiful local thermal spas over the centuries, but also protect the local communities against geological events such as earthquakes! </p>
				<p class="text-history-left"> *A uniquely Venetian term, ‘Brolo’ describes a stretch of arable land that generally accompanies a rural abode, roughly equivalent to the English ‘homestead’. </p>

			<div class="flex3">
				<p class="text-history-right"> Over the millions of years of Euganean history, many groups came and went. During the ice age, neanderthals (our close human relatives) settled the region, only to be replaced by hunter gatherers, and they in turn by farming peoples from modern day turkey (they are said to be the legendary Euganei people, who give the hills their name today).   </p>
				<p class="text-history-right"> Eventually, the ancestors of the modern inhabitants of Veneto, the ancient Veneti, arrived in the area in around 1000 B.C.E., having conquered, or perhaps assimilated, the previous inhabitants, they developed a horse-based agricultural society, with their elites being called ‘ekupetars’, or “horse-lords”. </p>
				<p class="text-history-right"> These ancient Veneti inhabited the modern land of Galzignano for many centuries, farming the lands here and building settlements, and defending these lands from the Etruscans to the south, when in the 6th century B.C.E. the Celtic Gaulish tribes invaded all of Northern Italy (coming in from over the Alps). While many of them tried to attack the Veneti, one of these tribes, the Cenomanni, became friendly with them, and were allowed to form many settlements throughout Veneto. One of these is said to be Galzignano itself, perhaps being the origin of Galzignano’s name. </p>

				<div class="flex3">
					<p class="text-history-left"> But to the south, a distant relative of the Veneti was forging a new empire, and they too would make a great mark on our history. In the 3rd century B.C.E, the Roman Republic was expanding into northern Italy, coming into contact with those Gallic tribes that the Veneti were also fighting. As such, both the Veneti and Romans decided that an alliance between the two people was mutually beneficial. And so Veneto slowly underwent a process of Romanization, gradually becoming a part of the Roman realm, with the Veneti themselves adopting both Roman language and customs. </p>
					<p class="text-history-left"> Many Roman structures and buildings were built during this period, in both the surrounding regions and the Euganeian communities. Near the end of our own Brolo, for example, a column from a Roman structure was excavated in the 20th century, showing just how extensive settlement was in this period. </p>

				<div class="flex3">
					<p class="text-history-right"> But not all things last, and after a long period of decline, the Roman Empire finally fell in the 5th century A.D. with grave consequences for the local area.  </p>
					<p class="text-history-right"> With the rule of law falling apart, many foreign tribes entered the area to sack and pillage the land, with the nearby cities (such as Padua) being razed to the ground multiple times (leading many Veneti to flee to the coastal swamps and islands, where they would found the city of Venice). After the brutal invasions of the Huns under Attila, and later the Ostrogoths, the region of Veneto finally returned to Roman rule under the Eastern Roman Empire of Justinian the Great in the 6th century. However, this was not to last as the Germanic Langobards would soon invade Italy at the end of the century, with much of Veneto being a frontier in between the skirmishing Byzantine empire, and the Kingdom of the Lombards. The Eugani hills themselves sat on the border of these two realms, with many nearby areas having been sites of battles between the Germanic invaders and the Eastern Romans, though Galzignano itself seems to have been spared any such brutality from these battles, tucked away within the hills. </p>
					<p class="text-history-right mgnl-23"> However the Kingdom of the Lombards would itself be conquered by Charlemane and his Kingdom of the Franks in the late 8th century, with most of Veneto (including the Eugani hills) then becoming a part of the Frankish successor state of Germany under Otto the Great, which became the Holy Roman Empire in 962 A.D. While initially a centralised state, the authority of the Emperor gradually waned, so that local cities, princes and dukes could forge their own realms within the empire, through both economic development and war. This period saw the emergence of many city states throughout Italy, with the competition in between them leading to much artistic and technological development.  </p>
					<p id="5" class="text-history-right mgnl-23"> Locally, the Eugani hills formed part of the border in between the competing duchies of Verona and Padua, with Galzignano being under the dominion of Padua, and the nearby town of Este being within the realm of Verona. Eventually, in the late 14th century, the duchy of Padua (under the family of Carrara) would expand across much of Veneto, conquering the cities of Verona and Vicenza. Threatened by the rising power of the ambitious duke of Padua, the now powerful republic of Venice intervened in the region in 1404, with the aim of liberating the conquered cities from Carrarese rule, with their final defeat in the autumn of 1405. Bringing an end to the duchy of Padua as the overlords of the Euganeian hills, and ushering in a long period under the Republic of Venice. </p>

				<div class="flex3">
					<p class="text-history-left"> The area surrounding our Brolo underwent much change during the times of the Republic (1405-1797). For one, this is the time in which the current land of the brolo first came into our family (as far as we know), though established as a tavern during these years. With the passing of land reclamation acts by Venice, this period also saw the construction of many villas throughout Galzignano, not only as a show of the economic prosperity that this period brought, but also the influence of the Venetian elite in the area (To this day, many canals exist around Galzignano that used to lead all the way to Venice, built as way to easily connect the village, and its surrounding villas, with the prosperous city). Eventually though, after a long period of decline that began in the mid 17th century, the Venetian Republic, along with the Euganean Hills, was conquered by Napoleon in 1797, to be handed over to Austria in the later treaty of Vienna. Finally, in 1866, after losing in battle to the Prussians, the Austrian Empire was forced to hand over the whole region of Veneto to Italy, beginning the Italian control over the region that continues today. </p>

				<div class="flex3">
					<p class="text-history-right"> The 19th century was a period of growth for many areas of Europe. Here in Veneto however, the turbulent events from the turn of the century onwards had greatly impoverished the region, forcing many to migrate to far off continents, such as the Americas, to find a way to survive. Those who stayed however, were forced to rely on rural agricultural tradition to survive off of subsistence farming. </p>
					<p class="text-history-right"> In spite of the great difficulty brought by such a lifestyle, the volcanic nature of the soil meant that it was rich in many of the minerals needed by crops, providing it with high fertility. As a consequence, the expansion of local farming in this period permitted the reinforcement of existing agricultural traditions, resulting in produce of excellent quality that continues to be grown today. </p>
					<p  id="7" class="text-history-right"> However these times did see the growth of a profitable new sector. As ancient Roman thermal baths were excavated, which had made use of the extensive reserves of hot, thermal water that exists under the Euganeian hills, local entrepreneurs started a plethora of thermal spas and baths in the surrounding towns and villages. To this day, thermal tourism forms a large part of the local economy of the region surrounding Galzignano.  </p>

			<div class="flex3">
				<p class="text-history-left"> The early 20th century was also a time of hardship for the Galzignano community, and is a source of many memories for the eldest among us. It was during this period that Italy, with limited industrial capacity, committed to both World Wars, with action being seen in the local region in both of them. In the first war, many farm hands were called to fight in trenches only a few kilometres to our north, not only causing extensive social tragedy, but also leaving rural families and brolos with a greatly reduced workforce, making rural life during and after the war far more laborious. </p>
				<p class="text-history-left"> The second however was worse still, with heavy bombing throughout Italy, destroying countless houses and structures, along with an even greater human toll on the Italian population than that had devastated them in the First World War. On top of this, the end of the war saw a harsh occupation of the region by German forces, resulting in the harassment and persecution of the locals by the occupying soldiers. </p>
				<p class="text-history-left"> By the end of the Second World War, rural communities around Veneto were devastated, with the destruction of much of the region's infrastructure and manpower, and very little industry that could bring a quick post-war growth. In spite of this, the local communities would eventually recover economically, though this would take many decades. </p>

				<p class="text-history-right"> In the aftermath of the Second World War, the village of Galzignano, like much of Italy, found itself heavily impoverished. However, with the tough surviving and entrepreneurial farmhands taking it upon themselves to rebuild their community, many family businesses started to pop up in the area, with many of them being carried, by the hard work of the locals, to national (and sometimes international) status. This period saw a boom in local artisanry, manufacturing, and fashion, many times headed by individuals with very little capital or education, but of incredible resilience, ingenuity and diligence, creating goods and services of the internationally highest quality. </p>
				<p class="text-history-right"> Our own family head, Luciano Marchesan, owner of our brolo, and founder of our company, was one of these individuals. Originating from an agricultural upbringing, he pursued a living in fashion, and founded Marchesan Tailoring, a business that continues to produce some of the highest quality tailoring in Italy, and creating attire for some of the worlds most affluent individuals. In his twilight years, he took it upon himself to continue his family’s agricultural traditions by returning some of his ancestral lands back into our current brolo, with the help of his family.  </p>
				<p class="text-history-right"> On the back of an extensive history of resilience, hard-work, and local tradition, we aim to extend our lavender business, founded in 2024, for generations to come. </p>
